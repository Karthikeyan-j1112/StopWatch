# Stopwatch
 
This is a simple web project build on React.js.

This serves as an stopwatch for the users, and helps to mark laps.
It can store the laps and final timer in the local storage and retrive it on next arrival.

This web app is hosted online with the help of [Netilfy.com](https://www.netlify.com/).
